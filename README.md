## About

OpenSafe protects open source contributors by scanning GitHub repositories for malicious code, backdoors, and dangerous dependencies **before you clone or contribute**. Using AI-powered analysis, OpenSafe helps developers safely identify which open source projects are likely safe to explore and contribute to and which are not.
