## About

OpenSafe helps protect open source contributors by scanning GitHub repositories for malicious code and dangerous dependencies **before they clone or contribute**. Powered by AI analysis, OpenSafe identifies which open source projects are likely safe to clone and contribute to and which ones are not.
